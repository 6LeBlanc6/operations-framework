# ðŸ’š Beneficiaries and Rotation Concept

## Pilot phase

The proposal is to use established and registered non-profit associations, and ideally, those having  a track record in the Cardano ecosystem.

For the pilot phase, the proposal is to have a voting of **one non-profit organization per Region** \
**--> (goal: be global from the beginning).**

The voting will determine the sequence of the rotation; but all selected organizations would receive the #CardanoCommunity donations.

The following survey was created in order to get details from potential non-profit organizations:

Entry page to the survey

* \<Proposal from Pacific Town Hall>
  * \

* \<Proposal from LATAM>\

* Eastern Town Hall - [mie.tran.0407](https://app.gitbook.com/u/2p2PehpklHdd6vzYpjYtESFf5kq2 "mention")
  * Non-profit organization which is registered in Vietnam / Malaysia or other Eastern Country
  * Ideally: the association is related to Cardano
  * Evaluate if deploying a local "version" of DirectEd (using Cardano Smart Contracts) would be an interesting path for Vietnam or other countries in Eastern.
* \<Proposal from Africa Town Hall>\

* **Proposal European Cardano Community: DirectEd Development Foundation**\

  * Founder: [Simon SÃ¤llstrÃ¶m](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-s%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m-3659b616b/?originalSubdomain=uk) (LinkedIn)
  * Merits: Catalyst Funded proposal, usage of Cardano smart contracts and Identity Solutions, established organization since more than 1 year.
  * Rationale:
    * For the pilot phase, it is important to select organizations which are already known to the wider #CardanoCommunity.
      * The registration of DirectEd in the UK as a charitable organization can be verified.\

        * The entity has already developed a certain network effect, giving the initiative a better chance of success.

## Number of Charities after the Pilot Phase

Proposal: limit the number to \`x\` (1 x EU, 1 x Africa, 1 x LATAM, 1 x Eastern, 1 x MENA, 1 x Pacific)&#x20;

\-> 6 charities

## Application and Selection Process

* Pre-screening will be done by the regional town halls -> creation of a "short list"
* Goal is to include the #CardanoCommunity in the selection of the beneficiaries.
* Also to make the program accessible to a wider range of non-profit organizations.
* The application process must be simple, but contain sufficient information and documentation to avoid tax or other regulatory risks.

## Rotation Process after the Pilot Phase

Ideas:

* First rotation after reaching 500 USD&#x20;
* Second at 1000 USD
* Third at 2500 USD
* After that - re-evaluate the frequency of change and the number of beneficiaries in the initiative.

When amount is reached, ADA will be sent to the  recipient wallet of the respective beneficiaries.

## $ADA-Handle

The $ADA Handle -> $CardanoGives was minted and shall be used for the campaign when it starts.

7 Trusted Community Members have been identified; the final MultiSig has to be tested, the $Adahandle NFT will be sent to the MultiSig wallet.

## Off-Boarding Process

* Which events would trigger the need to remove an organization from the pool of selected beneficiaries?
* Which process would apply?
