# ðŸª´ Pilotphase Communication Plan

Different roles, what will happen when, etc.

What do we expect from the different roles?

(by phases)

## Alignment with the Communications Team. &#x20;

* Outcome (Meeting on Dec 6th, Hanna, Ricardo):
  * a) Makes sense to start with 3 out of 4 TCM
  * b) Approach via wide-spread projects (see above) is the preferred route. Ricardo to contact the different projects (Hosky, SNEK and Book.io).  Hanna will put Ricardo in touch with Zac (Head of Token) / Partnerships.
  * Prepare a Newsletter informing about the status and stating clearly, which steps are required from which individuals by which date.
    * (e.g. at a certain date, distribute, re-tweet the post by the ECC and friends - in all available channels)
    * Define a #HashTag for the campaign -> **#CardanoGives**&#x20;
    * First information -> teaser about what we are planning to accomplish. (date A)
    * Second information -> Hosting an X-space (to be aligned with which co-host) (data B) - e.g. CardanoSpot / SustainableAda
    * Third information -> Dec 21st - European Town Hall with special guests from LATAM, MENA, Africa (in clarification), Eastern (in clarification)
    * Fourth communication -> snippet from the common Town Hall - 20 seconds clip informing the community about the upcoming vote to get us started
    * Fifth communication -> all nominated charities post a short video or information about their goals and how they are related to the Cardano Ecosystem (using the #**CardanoGives** hashtag)
    * Sixth communication -> bounty for everyone to create a logo for #**CardanoGives**
    * Seventh information -> vote about the first steps in launching the initiative -> determining the sequence for the nominated charities
