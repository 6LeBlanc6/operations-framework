# ðŸ—’ Voting Concept

## Evaluation of options - meetings conducted

* On Nov. 19th 20:00 CET - Meeting with Pi Lanningham from Sundaelabs
* On Dec. 4th 12:00 CET - meeting with the Summon Platform (Adam Rusch)&#x20;
* On Dec. 8th 18:00 CET - Meeting with [Logan Panchot](https://app.gitbook.com/u/EVaz4x6LQReOemA3NDaNssmhnsG3 "mention") and [Justin Schreiner](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Gr3f6o7Uwzfqzuis7t7e8xVXxtJ2 "mention"),

## Evaluation of options

### SundaeLabs - Voting Tool

* Participants: Pi Lanningham, Ricardo Burgos
  * Idea: use the Sundae Labs solution for planning and documenting the voting for several aspects in a verifiable manner.&#x20;
  * Advantage is that there are no costs involved in \*casting\* a vote.
  * Because during the voting phase, an hourly aggregation of the data is stored on-chain, there would be some fees involved with using the SundaeLabs system.
  * The advantage is that any person participating in the vote can verify that the voting is&#x20;
  * Pi L. will speak with the team in the next days and will inform us what is doable (to reduce the cost thus maximizing the impact, especially in the initial rounds).
* Update - Dec. 4th 2023: \
  per day 50 ADA  -  would be the initial cost factor for using the SundaeLabs system. Next step - evaluate further alternatives.

### Summon Platform

* Participants: Adam Rusch, Ricardo Burgos
  * The Summon Platform allows for collecting votes based on either ADA holdings or other tokens (NFT, FT).
  * As in other systems, there is not cost involved in \*casting\* a vote.
  * In the current setup, preparing and publishing a vote is free. However, there will be charge in future - the modality is still in discussion within the Summon Team.
  * A global, blockchain-wide voting would require some preparation by the Summon Team, and most probably, there would be a fee involved in such an **open, ada-based** voting.&#x20;
  * Adam recommended to evaluate if we can collect receiving wallets (e.g. using a WebForm) of participants that want to take part in our initiative. Then, using an upload into the Summon system, those accounts would be allowed to take part in the respective ballots for preparaing the Global Donations Campaign.
  * Next steps:&#x20;
    * Adam will clarify the cost structure and feedback to us.
    * Preparation of a WebForm to collect receiving wallets from the community and alignment with all town halls about this.
    * Alternatively, in alignment with different wide-spread projects (e.g. Hosky Token, World Mobile Token, Book.io, SNEK) - derive which wallets hold at least one of those tokens, and list those wallets as "allowed-to-vote".

## Clarity Protocol

Participants: [Logan Panchot](https://app.gitbook.com/u/EVaz4x6LQReOemA3NDaNssmhnsG3 "mention") and [Justin Schreiner](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Gr3f6o7Uwzfqzuis7t7e8xVXxtJ2 "mention"), [Ricardo Burgos](https://app.gitbook.com/u/zMDs1ZDkDHcRlHqHTAAnCOrjK1A3 "mention")

* The upcoming version of Clarity Protocol allows so called Agora DAO - community driven decision making.&#x20;
* Results from ballots trigger Smart Contracts based on the outcome.
* Potentially, such an AgoraDAO could be used based on two different tokens in order to
  * trigger donations (e.g. 7 keys in form of an NFT to the 7 Trusted Community Members)
  * participate in the decision making process (target audience: the broader Cardano Community) - ideally using ADA for the voting power determination.
  * Cost indication: [Logan Panchot](https://app.gitbook.com/u/EVaz4x6LQReOemA3NDaNssmhnsG3 "mention") [Justin Schreiner](https://app.gitbook.com/u/Gr3f6o7Uwzfqzuis7t7e8xVXxtJ2 "mention") - could you provide some details here?

## Future thoughts

* to be worked out.
