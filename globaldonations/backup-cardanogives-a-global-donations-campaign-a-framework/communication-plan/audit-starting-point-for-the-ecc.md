## Purpose

Several communities are focusing on their internal goals and on the fulfilment of commitments from the Catalyst proposals. This is in principle good and important, however, **a common element (e.g. project or initiative) which creates a global identification with the Cardano core values (i.e. decentralization, fair, freedom, banking-the-unbanked) is lacking**.&#x20;

## Message

* "One World --> One Cardano Community"
* "Let's come together and change some lives"
* ... (lets align with the community / brainstorming)&#x20;
