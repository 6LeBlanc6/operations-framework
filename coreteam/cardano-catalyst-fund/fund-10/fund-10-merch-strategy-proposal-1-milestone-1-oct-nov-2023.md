## Merchandise

The Cardano Summit event serves as the year-end culmination of the community, drawing together various personalities from around the world, and taking place at multiple locations. It presents the perfect opportunity for the team to distribute merchandise, especially considering that no other event dates have been confirmed before the conclusion of the proposal. Therefore, the proposed execution plan for this initiative is to consolidate the budgets of M1 and M2 into one and distribute it as follows:&#x20;

Total: 1,695 ADA&#x20;

* Ricardo Burgos (confirmed): DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany Summit - 423 ADA&#x20;
* Marcus Ubani (to be confirmed): Netherlands Summit - 423 ADA &#x20;
* Mauro Andreoli (confirmed): Dubai - 423 ADA&#x20;
* Davide Lucchesi (usage in Italy) - 423 ADA

If any of them CANNOT attend, their share will be distributed equally among the remaining members. If only one of them can attend, they will be allocated the entire budget.&#x20;

In case of consolidation into two or even one member, 3 out of the 4 team members must approve the planned purchase of digital or physical assets.

If three or four members share the budget, each team member is free to establish their preferred distribution criteria.&#x20;

However, they are obliged to take a minimum of 4 photos and/or a video with the individuals who receive the merchandise to be documented in internal records and in the monthly and closing reports. The photos and videos should be in horizontal format to allow for YouTube videos or full-screen posts.&#x20;

In January, which is typically a month with lower digital event participation, NFT giveaways will be conducted to encourage engagement. The specific collections and artists for the NFTs will be determined at a later date.
