# ðŸ›« Closing Report - Fund 10 Scope

Our closing report contains the following sections:

* An update of KPI for the complete proposal
* A report showing all inflows and outflows by category
* An overview of all recorded YouTube events and X-Spaces (via the EU Town Hall Website)

Based on the closing report, the team will creat a closing video which summarizes the main aspects of the closing report (approx. 5 min duration).

### Update of KPI

The following table shows the tracking of our KPI for the Fund 10 proposal timeframe.&#x20;

Given the difficult market conditions, the growth of the community is noticeable and is reflected in the KPI. We highlighted those values in "green" (column "Goal") which were met according to the planning when submitting the proposal.&#x20;

In the case of the number of participants in the Zoom calls, we didn't quite reach the target value. The teams is continuously evaluating ideas in order to increase the interest of the community and their participation in our online events.&#x20;

Main area of focus going forward is the usage of Discord and the engagement there. As reflected in the numbers, we did not reach the desired level of activity there.

Collaborations between founders and people wanting to learn about the different projects will be key to continue developing our community in upcoming months.&#x20;

Note that the remaining funds (last payout after closeout) - will be used to bridge the timeframe for operations until Fund 11 becomes active. A carry over by categories will be respected, so that planned budgets per category are not exceeded.

### Overview of YouTube Recordings and X-Spaces

An overview of the YouTube sessions (i.e. Fireside Chats / Town Hall Meetings) is documented in the respective monthly report pages.

For easier access, here you find the link to the YouTube Channel, used for publishing all sessions.
