# Delegation Rotation

By establishing a new delegation rotation, we could create a blueprint for other regional Townhalls aiming for the following achievements.

* a rotation delegation to shorten the gaps between the long cycles of xSPO and F2LB rotations
* support and foster the network of small stakepools, while enhancing decentralization
* providing a more robust network to enhance the transmission speed of global nodes for Cardano operations
* preparing the network for Midnight
