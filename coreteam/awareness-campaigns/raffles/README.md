# Raffles

### Use your Project NFT to create awareness.

We want to make a special distribution over the Christmas time.

During the year we will have also raffles.

So whatever you feel comfortable with to distribute is great.

**Why are we doing this?** - We want to see what the ecosystem is about and provide projects a platform to get their word out. We're not endorsing but provide a positive environment.

This will drive engagement for you, us, and the participating community members.

The best part: You're getting feedback if your community really understands the core values of your project.



There are different types of distribution, so let us know which suits you best.
