# Christmas Calendar Short Pitch Contest



We want to make a special distribution over the Christmas Time



### **How it works**

We will engage our followers in 24 Short Pitch contests about your project.

So we will create a Banner with a reference to your X-account.

By comparing the engagement of the posts, the admin-team will decide which post explains your project the best.

### Distribution

Christmas Distribution will possibly have a little delay during the festivity days.\

Update on Dec. 9th 2023:

Engagement has been extremely low for the posts requiring the people to engage both in X and in Discord.  \
\
On the 9th, that requirement was eliminated, and more engagement took place in X. \
\
Team decision to be taken, how to move forward.
