# ðŸ“¦ Managing Changes

* For our change management in GitBook, we differentiate between:
  * minor changes (e.g. typos, adding examples) and
  * important changes\
    \

* Minor changes are:
  * correction of typos
  * adding examples
  * rephrasing, moving single sentences around for better readability\
    \
    \--> Minor changes are done and merged directly by the team members.\

* Important changes are:
  * Any change to out [internal-rules](internal-rules/ "mention")
  * Any change that might have a direct or indirect influence on the rewards for team members or other  members as well as to expenses or budget items
  * Any change regarding the **structure** of the GitBook\
    \
    \--> Important changes require at least 2 other team members to review before merging.

More details:

* Changes of important documents (i.e. those that require alignment of 3/4 of the team) should be done in a **Combined** Change Request (CCR). This is in order to ensure that other members see what others have already changed/commented.
* Minor changes (e.g. corrections, examples) should be added in a separate change request and merged by the person doing the correction. There is no need to inform the other team members.

{% hint style="info" %}
An exception to this rule is, if the page where the correction is required, is one which is being modified in a **combined** CR (see above).
{% endhint %}
