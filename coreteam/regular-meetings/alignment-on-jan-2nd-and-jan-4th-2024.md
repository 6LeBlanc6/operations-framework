# ❄ Alignment on Jan 2nd and Jan 4th 2024

Topics for discussion

* December closing&#x20;
  * Threshold: 60 points
  * Ricardo to complete the preparation for payout - it seems next Catalyst distribution will be on the 3rd Monday in Jan (Jan 18th)
* Participation in the Admin Team&#x20;
  * Idea: start with some bounties - after alignment with potential candidates
  * Preparation period - 1 month&#x20;
  * Idea: contribution into the #CardanoGives initiative - e.g. reach out to projects
* Upcoming FSC&#x20;

Continuation on Thu 4th 2024

* Status giveaways -> tx created but 2 failed. Will be created sequentially. Feedback given to the Summon team
* TypeForm - 1 month subscription -> recommendation by Simon S. to use Tally.So -> worked very well, used now for #CardanoGives preparation ([tally.so](https://tally.so))
* Migration GitBook&#x20;
  * 1 step: duplication of the repository
  * 2 step: move the copy (not the original) to the EU Cardano Gitbook
  * 3 step: change access rights to "read-only" for the EU Cardano area in the Web3 User Group
  * 4 step: add a remark in the "new" EU Cardano Gitbook, that any change prior to the date of migration can be found under the link of the Web3 User Group Gitbook.
  * 5 step: add information and link that all changes after migration date will be done in the "new" EU Cardano GitBook
* F11 presentation
