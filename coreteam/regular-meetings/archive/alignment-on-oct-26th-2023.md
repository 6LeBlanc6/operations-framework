## Discussion Points



*   Pick an SPO for our treasury

    * Idea is to rotate the delegation with other SPO. Criteria to be defined which are "allowed" to participate. Re-use of template from other similar iniciatives will be used (avoid re-inventing the wheel). \
      \
      Next step: going through the templates with the current SPO-circle (BIRTH, RUMOR, CLINK, GOMA)
