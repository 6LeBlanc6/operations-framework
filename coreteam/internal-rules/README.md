# üìè Internal Rules

Version 1.0 will be submitted for internal voting. Agreement is required by a simple majority to declare this document as valid.

Current Version: 0.95 - First draft

## Definitions

**Team Members** are Marcus Ubani, Davide Lucchesi, Ricardo Burgos and Mauro Andreoli.

**ECC points** are assigned to events (e.g. participation in a fireside chat) and to the fulfillment of deliverables. Tasks have values of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100 depending of the difficulty and effort involved in their completion. See [https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker). As a calibration value we define 1 point for simple tasks (approx. 10 min) and 5 points for at least 45 min of participation on the Town Hall Meeting.&#x20;

## General Aspects

1. Rewards of Team Members will be based on a combination of participation in the Town Halls and the completion of deliverables for the respective month.
2. The maximum rewards for a team member are bound to the outlined deliverables in the funded proposal. This allows for flexibility in covering the workload for fellow team members if they aren't able to deliver their package of the proposed tasks. (as per the breakdown in the [cost-timeline-and-deliverables.md](../cardano-catalyst-fund/fund-10/cost-timeline-and-deliverables.md "mention") page). Note that approx. 30% has been requested for M1 (covering 2 months), approx. 30% for M2 (covering 1 month) an the remaining approx. 40% fter completion of the proposal (incl. closeout report and closeout video).
   1. The max. reward of the team in ADA, provided by Catalyst Funds, remains fixed as per the proposal and will not be merged with the other funds.&#x20;
   2. Merchandise articles do not count as deductibles from rewards. Expenses are not rewards and can be compensated by remainders of the treasury.
3. The rewards for each team member is variable (0% to 100%) - the percentage is based on the participation in ECC meetings and completion of tasks.
4. We strive for a balanced workload within the team, but imbalances might occur due to outside effects.
5. Top priority are the deliverables of the funded proposal.
6. Excess funds might be allocated to new tasks if agreed by 2/3 of the team, as long as
   1. the funded deliverables are successfully fullfilled.
   2. a potentially needed reporting to the Catalyst Funds committee has been conducted.
7. In lieu of good team spirit, we assume that team members will not aim to take away task from each other. However, for each month of operation,
   1. the team agrees on a threshold (i.e. number of ECC points) that must be reached in order to receive 100% of the planned compensation (Plan table).
   2. after imbalances in the workload have been cleared, the amount that is not issued to the team remains in the treasury.&#x20;
   3. team members can agree on additional tasks for that team member that didn't reach 100% to deliver in the next period for this month's remainder in the treasury.&#x20;
      1. These additional tasks must be approved by at least two other members.&#x20;
      2. Upon completion of such additional tasks and providing evidences for their completion, the team member can get additional points in the next month&#x20;
      3. The maximum level as stated above in point nr. 2 cannot be exeeded by such an action.
      4. The grace period for the remainder can be carried over for one month only.&#x20;
8. Any balances in the budget for team member compensation after all closing activities and final payment have been issued shall remain in the treasury for future months of operation.
9. Additional budget for planning and executing X-Spaces (Twitter Spaces) is reserved for community members outside of the admin team.
10. Merchandise funds might be directly applied to the compensation for event hosts if the team sees that more value can be created through this decision.
11. Payment transactions (e.g. for software and licenses) require evidences (e.g. invoice + payment transaction). The evidences must be confirmed by two other team members prior to issuing the payment.



{% hint style="info" %}
Note that we changed these rules on Dec. 8th 2023 to accomodate for the fact that sometimes, a team member has to focus on other projects or tasks temporarily; thus requiring the other team members to cover additional tasks in that period.
{% endhint %}

## Compensation process for team members

The following steps are required in order to process the team member compensation for the respective month:

1. Plan the events and planned deliverables incl. effort estimation (see **ECC points**)
2. Agreement on the participation and planned deliverables for the respective month.&#x20;
3. Each team member submits evidences for the completion of the deliverables.
4. At least two other team members confirm the provided evidences for deliverables for each other team member.
5. Preparation and trigger of the payment transaction.
6. Each team member validates the transaction (3 signatures required to commit the payment).
