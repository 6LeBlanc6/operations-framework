{% endhint %}

**Working Group:** Ricardo Burgos, Marcus Ubani

## Timeline

A potential team member will first become a Country Coordinators (CC) for the duration of a Catalyst Cycle (approx. 4 months).

## Compensation&#x20;

The compensation of team members will be rewarded through milestones and bounties.&#x20;

Milestones, and bounties will be regularly set in our Catalyst proposals.

Other new project within a funded execution cycle will only be rewarded if there is an excess of funds.&#x20;

As funds are transparently handled via [MultiSig](../../multisig-for-ecc-operation.md) and [TimeSheet](../../).&#x20;

Existing rules on compensation and documentation apply.

## Milestone reward principles

Team Members of the Admin/Core team will only have access to funds predefinded by the proposal milestones. If a memebers take on additional tasks then the existing preceding rules will apply.

## Project bounty principles

Country Coordinators (CC) will have a prefered role to apply for bounties.

These bounties will presented to the CC network.
