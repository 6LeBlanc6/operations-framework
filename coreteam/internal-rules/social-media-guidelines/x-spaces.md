# ✖ X Spaces



{% hint style="info" %}
One of the goals when creating our community is to establish high-quality regional or community discussion spaces. True decentralization is achieved through clear and concise objectives. Our initial funded proposal includes a budget to encourage community members to initiate these conversation and discussion spaces, aiming to serve as the starting point for potential relationships and collaborations. However, we believe that clear rules must be in place to prevent the involvement of bad actors who are solely interested in monetary compensation rather than community value.&#x20;

Therefore, we are establishing the following rules.
{% endhint %}

**Application**

§1 Anyone worldwide can express their interest in acting as an X-Space Host, Co-Host as part of the ECC.&#x20;

a) XSpaces have mainly the purpose of exploring, building and fostering a new part of the European Community (e.g. different languages).&#x20;

b)&#x20;

§2 An individual can only receive compensation for hosting a space once a month. The host can be granted an exception, which must be approved by 3/4 of the team. Either the following cases must apply:

a) Replacement or steping in for a sudden retraction of a host's space.&#x20;

b) Taking over an additional space exploration.

§3 The interested requester must meet several requirements simultaneously:&#x20;

* They must be a participant in the community's Discord&#x20;
* and hold the "country coordinator"-role&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have the role yet, you can request it by tagging the team in Discord after introducing yourself in the "introduce yourself" channel
{% endhint %}

After hosting their first space, this "country coordinator" will receive the "host"-role.&#x20;

This will allow other members to distinguish them for upcoming spaces.



**Scheduling**

* They must be a participant in the community's Discord and&#x20;
* hold the "country coordinator" role. If the participant does not yet have the role, he/she can request it by tagging the team in Discord after introducing themselves in the "introduce yourself" channel.

§4 The requester will propose a day and time to coordinate the space setup.

§5 All spaces are hosted by one admin team member using the ECC X-account, which is non-negotiable. We will promote the space using our existing brand assets. Re-posting and promotion by the host should come naturally.

§6 To be eligible for compensation, the space must last a minimum of 40 minutes and have a minimum number of of 35 listeners (i.e. including those who listen to the recorded space latest 3 days after it took place).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** 10 live listeners and 25 listeners of the recording are deemed successful
{% endhint %}

**Rewards**

§7 The host will receive a total reward of 85 ADA for each space that meets the listed requirements.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although we will join with the X account to host the space, members of the EUCardano Core Team are not eligible for this kind of reward.
{% endhint %}

§8 Additionally, each space can have a co-host to assist with space organization tasks, who can receive the same compensation of 85 ADA, provided that the host confirms their participation and assistance.

§9 It is not allowed to have more than two (2) non-team-member hosts.
