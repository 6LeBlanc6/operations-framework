# ๐ Merchandise - General Rules

**Proposed Outline --> the points below should be sorted into the following headers**

* Introduction of new designs (products)
* Event Application Process
* Travel Expenses
* Acquisition of Digital Assets
* Providing Digital Assets from a Team member's portfolio

## Physical Merchandise

ยง1 The team has decided that, in order to avoid excessive shipping costs and customs complications with various countries worldwide, the delivery of physical merchandise will occur when a team member attends a community event.&#x20;

ยง2 Once a team member expresses their interest or confirms their travel plans, the team will pre-approve a budget for physical merchandise. This must be documented (e.g. in meeting minutes or Discord voting + screenshot).

ยง3 In case of unavailability of other team members, the member is granted the freedom to select the product and design according to the chosen event, provided it adheres to the brand identity and community colors. However, if at least one other member is available, confirmation should be sought, unless the decision would be redundant to a previous decision.

ยง4 If a new product or design is being introduced, the planned final product requires the approval of two out of the three remaining members. This must be documented (e.g. in meeting minutes or Discord voting + screenshot).

ยง5 The payment of the incurred cost will be done from the treasury after the evidences of the product have been submitted. Mandatory evidences are:

* photographs of the product itself +&#x20;
* invoice documents (PDF)

ยง6 The ADA conversion rate will be that of the date of the payment execution.&#x20;

## Digital Assets&#x20;

The advantages of blockchain technology eliminate the previously mentioned issues. Hence, a strategy of distributing NFTs through giveaways will be implemented to bolster the circulation of the digital economy within the ecosystem and support the creators of such assets.&#x20;

ยง7 The team will consistently strive to prioritize projects or initiatives in the following order:

1. Projects whose members or creators are active participants within the European Cardano Community.
2. Projects or initiatives that offer a practical utility.
3. Other projects within the Cardano network.&#x20;

ยง8 Applying the same criteria as the previous point, the acquisition of an asset will require the approval of three out of the four team members. This must be documented (e.g. in meeting minutes or Discord voting + screenshot).&#x20;

ยง9 The asset to be acquired and its specifications will be budgeted by the team.&#x20;

ยง10 It is not permitted to claim the administration of the acquisition as an additional task to their recurrent activities.

ยง11 The partial or complete amendment of the rules outlined above requires the approval and consent of at least three team members.

ยง12 If a team member has a digital asset and provides it for a giveaway or similar, then, the market price (i.e. floor price according to JPEG.STORE) must be used. This is to be documented in this GitBook at the time of transfer to the recipient.
