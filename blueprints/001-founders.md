a comprehensive guide by the European Cardano Community (ECC)  

Fund 11 - 2024  


## Introduction

This is an outline of how the journey as a founder could look like.  
We sincerely hope this basic script will help you leveraging our knowledge for your decision making.  
Special thanks goes to the [Cardano Community which voted for us in Cardano Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112747) to fund our work here.  

We will cover basic aspects of your legal duties, how to plan your marketing, simple scripts to improve your workflow, and share our experiences from building a community.  
We assume that you want to work in the realms of blockchain, crypto and ssi, so we'll add some of that spice, too.ðŸ˜Š 
However, most if not all of the knowlegde and rules derive from Web2, traditional markets, or at least interacting in the conjunction with the latter.  
Making this guide a good compass for Web2 and Web3 enthusiast.  

We hope to find many contribtors along the way to improve and expand on our knowledge provided.  
This is the reason why we have also initiated the [ECC Country Hubs](), a series of live events that we're sponsoring with the help of our funds from Cardano Catalyst.
