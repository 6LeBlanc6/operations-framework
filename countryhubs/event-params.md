# Event Parameter

Thank you for making the consideration to join us in improving the journey for founders and donors.  

The outspoken goal of our Country Hub events is to foster the personal interaction between community members   
whilst providing a knowledge transfer from and between seasoned members to newcomers of the blockchain and crypto community.  

Our main focus as per proposal is the creation of [blueprints for founders](https://github.com/eucardano/operations-framework/blob/main/blueprints/001-founders.md), and donation campaigns.  
Both already exist in the traditional world of entrepreneurship and finance.   
Founders often need a reasonable amount of time to get familiar with business administration tasks or basic legal coverage.  
Donation processes are accompanied with the hopes that the donation finds its way to the proclaimed purpose, in a legally safe process. 
Employees from medium and large sized companies can provide insights to the specifications needed to onboard blockchain start-ups into corporate environments.  
Feel free to propose an extension of the scope if you feel we could enhance the picture and onboarding process for knowledge seeking stakeholders.  
We assume the need of additional considerations when it comes to the community of blockchain and crypto.  

With this in mind, we are activley searching for hosts, seasoned in their fields, to cater for these tasks.  
You should be able to generate a feedback loop during the event so that we can combine your notes into a living guideline for the wider community.  
We call it a blueprint, a starting point of which we know that two founders will derive different paths from it.

Example questions:
> What is sufficiently decentralized?  
> Do I/we need to form a company?  
> What would be a good reporting mechanism?  
> Am I commencing tax evasion?  

As a host, you do not need to have the expertise to answer all the questions,  
but we expect you to be able to 

- guide your event through the process,
- invite experts,   
- or loop those questions back to us, so we can jointly distribute them amongst the other hubs as questions.  

This is a team-effort and the params, the events, and the blueprints will evolve with your feedback.  


Check out our üëâ[Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/eucardano/projects/8/views/4)üëà and consider hosting one of the `Country Hubs Event #x` that resonates with your passion and knowledge.

### Suggested Process

1. You find a topic that suits you and our [Event Params](https://github.com/eucardano/operations-framework/blob/main/countryhubs/event-params.md) (you are reading them atm) given in GitHub (you can be creative) . 
2. Filter our GitHub roadmap for "Country Hubs" and claim an item by commenting into it [click here](https://github.com/orgs/eucardano/projects/8/views/4?filterQuery=country+hubs)
3. Add dates, venue, and create a outline so you can share the item content with us and your participants. (Here is a great example: [Country Hub Greece](https://github.com/orgs/eucardano/projects/8/views/4?filterQuery=country+hubs&pane=issue&itemId=55727588))
4. a) Formerly:  Check out the [merch design](https://github.com/eucardano/operations-framework/blob/main/countryhubs/merchandise.md) - if you're doxxed with us and already are a familiar member of our community we will be able to reimburse you on that quote
4. b) New: Provide an amount of expected participants and we will ship the merch to you. Stock ordering is currently in process.
5. Get a quote for the venue and catering - if you're doxxed with us and already are a familiar member of our community we will be able to reimburse you on that quote. 
6. Market the workshop via our X account. If we know you from previous events, we can provide you creator access.
7. Hold the event and create content for us that we can reuse for our blueprints.
8. Provide a little recording for our YouTube (Could be a 1 minute short or the whole workshop)
9. Create a tweet and (optional) join our blueprint writing
10. Send us the final receipts to allow counterchecking with the pre-reimbursements.
11. If you have questions feel free to ask them in our Discord's [Country Hubs General Questions](https://discord.com/channels/994521479016357898/1235554708031279214), Discord's [#üÜò-support-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/994521479016357898/1187533142039478292) , or within your GitHub item/issue
