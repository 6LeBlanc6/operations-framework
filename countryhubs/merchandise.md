# Merchandise planing 
> Distribution Budget in ADA: 275 per Workshop / 1375 per Month / 5500 for F11

At an presumed market price of 0.42 EUR we reach a budget of 115 EUR per workshop.  
We assume that buying at a higher volume would decrease the price per merch.  

Initial thoughts are based on the target to use merch as a support for the workshops,  
and hence we vowing for the following:

### Average Participation Rate

10 Workshop members including the host should be a good average with a maximum rate of 20.  
This takes into account the catering considerations, too.  
We expect some workshops with low and some with the maximum participation.  

### Merchandise considerations:

With entering Milestone 2 now, we are able to calculate half of the total budget.  
If see a lower participation rate, then we will be able to use the remainders in the upcoming milestone and provide further merch to the community.
