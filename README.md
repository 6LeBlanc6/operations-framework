# Community Operations & Frameworks


This Repository is our contribution to the Cardano Ecosystem and beyond.
Please contribute, share, and expand on what you see. 


## What to expect here

### Planning and Execution in Public
This is a community contribution to blockchain-driven communities.
We're operating in the public and share our expertise in Business Operations with the wider public.

### Blueprints
We are building non-intrusive transparency frameworks for communities in public.

### Documentation for Catalyst funds
The European Cardano Community received funds for its operation during Cardano Catalyst Fund 10.
Thus we are documenting our workload and milestones here.

### Fireside chat / EU Town Hall slides
We host regular Fireside Chats / Town Halls every second Thursday. While we record those events and
publish the videos on YouTube, we will also add a copy of the slides we prepared for the presentation
here for you to look over and as a quick reference.

### Software or scripts
We may write simple scripts to automate many tasks. In case those may be useful to somebody else, we
will add them in our public repositories.
