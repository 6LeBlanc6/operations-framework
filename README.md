# Community Operations & Frameworks


This Repository is our contribution to the Cardano Ecosystem and beyond.
Please contribute, share, and expand on what you see. 


## What to expect here

### Planning and Execution in Public
This is a community contribution to blockchain-driven communities.
We're operating in the public and share our expertise in Business Operations with the wider public.

### Blueprints
We are building non-intrusive transparency frameworks for communities in public.

### Documentation for Catalyst funds
The European Cardano Community received funds for its operation during Cardano Catalyst Fund 10.
Thus we are documenting our workload and milestones here.
